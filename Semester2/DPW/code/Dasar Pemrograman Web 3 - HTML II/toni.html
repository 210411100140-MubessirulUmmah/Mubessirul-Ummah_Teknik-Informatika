        My first day of the trip! i can't belleve i finally got
        everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a segway,
        I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cellphone, ipod,
        digital camera, and a protein bar. just the essentials. As
        lao Tru would have said, "A Journey of a thousand  miles begin
        with one segway."
