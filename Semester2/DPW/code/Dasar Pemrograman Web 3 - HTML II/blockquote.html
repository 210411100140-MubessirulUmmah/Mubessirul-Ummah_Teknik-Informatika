    <p>
        I saw some Burma Shave style sigma signs on the
        side of the road today:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        Passing cars, When you can't see,
        may get you,
        A glimpse,
        Of eternity.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        I definitely won't be passing any cars.
    </p>
    <p>
        That's where the <blockquote>element comes
        in.  Unlike the <q>element, which is meant for</q>
        short quotes that are part of an existing paragraph,
        the</blockquote>element is meant for longer
        quotes that need to be displayed on their own.
    </p>
